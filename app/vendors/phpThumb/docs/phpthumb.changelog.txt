  � Added /demo/readme.demos.txt
  � Added 'wp', 'hp', 'wl', 'hl', 'ws', 'hs' parameters for

    ratio at the size you want without knowing ahead of time
    whether the image is wide or tall.
    (thanks mike�gdaymate*nl)
  � phpThumb.php can now also be called by passing parameters
    in $_SERVER['PATH_INFO']. Please see phpthumb.readme.txt
    (thanks javier�guegue*net)
  � MySQL data pulling configuration moved from phpThumb.php
    to phpThumb.config.php
  * "file" and "goto" parameters are now disabled by
    default (configurable in phpThumb.config.php but not
    recommended)
  * Cached files are now used from first instance, avoiding
    call to OutputThumbnail and preventing browser-side
    cache failure
  * Added config_allow_src_above_docroot (default=false) to
    prevent browsing filesystem outside document_root
    (thanks david�int0x80*com)
  * Added config_allow_src_above_phpthumb (default=true) to
    prevent access to files except in subdirectories of
    phpThumb installation  (thanks david�int0x80*com)
  * Added setParameter() and getParameter() functions
    (thanks werner*krauss�hallstatt*net)
  * SafeBackTick() renamed to SafeExec() and all execution
    functions are tried (exec, shell_exec, system, passthru)
    are tried in case one or more are disabled
    (thanks bkainers�gmail*com)
  * config_output_allow_enlarging has been removed from
    phpthumb.class.php, and 'output_allow_enlarging' has
    been removed from phpThumb.config.php

    scale. All 'wmt' is now 100=opaque, 0=transparent
    (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)
  * Bugfix: cache file failed if document_root had
    trailing slash.  (thanks lovinglobo�gmail*com)
  * Bugfix: [#1219422] Cache filename structure modified to
    avoid excessively long filenames (cache filenames are
    now limited to 142 characters + length of
    $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'])
    (thanks trungie�users*sourceforge*net)
  * Bugfix: [#1211729] phpThumb.php fails to locate
    phpThumb.config.php if the two files are in the same
    directory but phpThumb.php is run through a sym link.
    (thanks allanbush�users*sourceforge*net)

v1.5.4 - May 27, 2005
  * Security issue with passthrough addressed
    (thanks david�int0x80*com)
  * 'wmt' now reads TTF fonts from the config font
    directory, or from anywhere if a path is specified in
    the font filename
    (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)
  * Changed default error_die_on_source_failure to true in
    phpThumb.config.php
  * Bugfix: Firefox (possibly other browsers) did not like
    the new (faster) cache retrieval method with Location
    header redirection if the cached filename does not have
    a recognized filename extension (.jpeg, .png, .gif).
    Cached images have therefore been renamed from *_jpeg to
    *.jpeg and the _qXX parameter has been removed for PNG
    and GIF output. Please use the included cache renamer:
    /demo/phpThumb.demo.cacheconvert2.php
    (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)
  * Bugfix: Changed "Content-type" to "Content-Type" in all
    header calls

    reported as such for remote images
    (thanks andgu842�student*liu*se)
  * Bugfix: very narrow images no longer produce Invalid
    Image Dimensions error  (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)

v1.5.3 - May 4, 2005
  � Added new filters:
    - 'wb' (White Balance) [ex: &fltr[]=wb|<c>]
      where <c> is the target hex color to white balance
      on, this color is what "should be" white, or light
      gray. The filter attempts to maintain brightness so
      any gray color can theoretically be used. If <c> is
      omitted the filter guesses based on brightest pixels
      in each of RGB
  � Cached files are used by a Location header instead of
    being passed through phpThumb.php using readfile
    (thanks newtn�thrillnerds*com)
  * Added 'cache_source_filemtime_ignore_local' and
    'cache_source_filemtime_ignore_remote' configurations
    to ignore source modification and/or removal
    (thanks raynerape�gmail*com)
  * Added 'md5s' parameter, which is the MD5 hash of the
    source image -- if this parameter is passed with the
    hash of the source image then the source image is not
    checked for existance or modification and the cached
    file is used (if available). If 'md5s' is passed an
    empty string then phpThumb.php dies and outputs the
    correct MD5 hash value.  This parameter is the single-
    file equivalent of 'cache_source_filemtime_ignore_*'
    configuration paramters  (thanks raynerape�gmail*com)
  * Added /demo/phpThumb.demo.object.php
  * Unused parameter 'bgt' removed
  * Added empty /cache/source/ directory to distribution
  * Added /demo/ and /docs/ and /fonts/ directories
  * Set default config_use_exif_thumbnail_for_speed = false
  * Bugfix: Wrapped output buffering around all
    include_once calls to prevent headers getting sent
    accidentally
  * Bugfix: md5_file and imagecolorallocatealpha calls
    were undefined under PHP v4.1.x  (thanks tom�emile*com)
  * Bugfix: default 'f' parameter ('jpeg') overrode
    config_output_format in object mode
    (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)
  * Bugfix: suppressed error message for IIS shell_exec
    errors  (thanks tom�emile*com)
  * Bugfix: Added PHP version check for stream_set_timeout
    for HTTP sources  (thanks raynerape�gmail*com)
  * Bugfix: overlay margins of 0.5-1.0 cause invalid image
    dimensions error  (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)
  * Bugfix: underlay margins were not working
    (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)
  * Bugfix: [#1187735] EXIF thumbnails were incorrectly
    output to the browser directly if requested thumbnail
    exactly matched EXIF dimensions
    (thanks reboot�users*sourceforge*net)

v1.5.2 - April 20, 2005
  � phpThumb.config.php is renamed to
    phpThumb.config.php.default to prevent accidental
    overwriting. Please migrate your old settings to the new
    file, delete your old config and rename the default to
    phpThumb.config.php
  � Added new filters:
    - 'blur' (Blur) [ex: &fltr[]=blur|<radius>]
      where (0 < <radius> < 25) (default = 1)
      (thanks thoensi�netcom*no for code)
    - 'hist' (Histogram)
      [ex: &fltr[]=hist|<b>|<c>|<w>|<h>|<a>|<o>|<m>]
      Where <b> is the color band(s) to display, from back
      to front (one or more of "rgba*" for Red Green Blue
      Alpha and Grayscale respectively);
      <c> is a semicolon-seperated list of hex colors to
      use for each graph band (defaults to FF0000, 00FF00,
      0000FF, 999999, FFFFFF respectively);
      <w> and <h> are the width and height of the overlaid
      histogram in pixels, or if <= 1 then percentage of
      source image width/height;
      <a> is the alignment (same as for "wmi" and "wmt");
      <o> is opacity from 0 to 100;
      <m> is the edge (and inter-tile) margin in percent
    - 'over' (OVERlay/underlay image) overlays an image on
      the thumbnail, or overlays the thumbnail on another
      image (to create a picture frame for example)
      [ex: &fltr[]=over|<i>|<u>|<m>|<o>]
      where <i> is the image filename; <u> is "0" (default)
      for overlay the image on top of the thumbnail or "1"
      for overlay the thumbnail on top of the image; <m> is
      the margin - can be absolute pixels, or if < 1 is a
      percentage of the thumbnail size [must be < 0.5]
      (default is 0 for overlay and 10% for underlay);
      <o> is opacity (0 = transparent, 100 = opaque)
      (thanks raynerape�gmail*com, shabazz3�msu*edu)
    - 'gray' (GRAYscale) [ex: &fltr[]=gray]
      is an alias to 100% desaturation
  * New configuration 'cache_source_directory' allows the
    unprocessed source image to be cached when source is
    HTTP or from a database  (thanks raynerape�gmail*com)
  * Added 'cache' subdirectory to phpThumb distribution
    since this is the default location for the cache
    folder.
  * Default value for config_error_die_on_source_failure
    changed to true  (thanks shabazz3�msu*edu)
  * Added checks to make sure $this->gdimg_output is a
    resource before allowing calls to RenderToFile or
    OutputThumbnail
  * Better error messages when phpThumb.config.php missing
  * Bugfix: watermark overlay margins were wrong
  * Bugfix: 'lvl' filter no longer processes if not needed
  * Bugfix: off-server thumbnail error message was wrong
  * Bugfix: several PHP safe mode fixes
    (thanks virginia�alertbutnotalarmed*com)
  * Bugfix: cache filenames broken for filter parameters
    with paths  (thanks srceric�users.sourceforge.net)

v1.5.1 - April 06, 2005
  * Added some security upgrades:
    - 'config_*' parameters cannot be passed by GETstring
    - 'config_nooffsitelink_require_refer' is a new option
      (disabled by default) that only allows calls to
      phpThumb() from a refering domain listed in
      'config_nooffsitelink_valid_domains'
    - disallowed paramters now generate an error image if
      present in the GETstring
    - 'high_security_enabled' if set to true enabled new
      mode of verification, and requires a small function
      to generate a hash for calls to phpThumb:
      echo '<img src="'.phpThumbURL('src=pic.jpg&w=50').'">';
      This function is supplied at the bottom of
      phpThumb.config.php  (thanks paul�stonie*co*uk)
  � Added new parameter "new" (phpThumb.php only) which can
    create a new image without using "src" parameter. Set
    "&new=<b>|<o>" where <b> is the background hex color,
    <o> is (optional) opacity (0=transparent, 100=opaque).
    (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)
  � Added new filters:
    - 'sep' (Sepia) [ex: &fltr[]=sep|<value>|<color>]
      where <value> is a number between 0 and 100 for the
      amount of colorization (default=50), and <color> is
      the hex color to colorize to (default=A28065).
      (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)
    - 'lvl' (Levels) [ex: &fltr[]=lvl|<channel>|<min>|<max>
      where <channel> can be one of 'r', 'g', 'b', 'a' (for
      Red, Green, Blue, Alpha respectively), or '*' for all
      channels based on average grayscale value (default).
      <min> and <max> are the clip points for the levels
      (range = 0-255) and are set to clip 0.1% of each end
      by default. Use -1 for min and/or max to invoke auto-
      detect mode. Using default parameters (&fltr[]=lvl)
      is similar to Auto Contrast in Adobe Photoshop.
  * Bugfix: Image MIME header was incorrect for cached
    images.
  * Bugfix: Cache was broken for images pulled from a
    database in phpThumb.php
    (thanks dragutin*cvetkovic�dragontech-ltd*com)
  * Bugfix: Hotlink/Offsite prevention was broken when
    image was already cached.
  * Bugfix: ImageMagick path was incorrect in some cases
    (thanks joshg�twcny*rr*com)

    (thanks matt�hellstrominc*com)
  * Bugfix: Added datestamp to cached filenames for remote
    (HTTP) files, and better warning for caching
    (thanks a*gambino�abramo*it)
  * Faster BMP parsing  (thanks sgeppert�mail*utexas*edu)
  * Added 'error_die_on_source_failure' configuration to
    allow invalid source images to show an error rather
    than output unmodified source image.
    (thanks mindpixel�gmail*com)
  * Added $phpThumb->fatalerror which will contain the
    text of the fatal error if 'error_die_on_error' is
    false.  (thanks mindpixel�gmail*com)

v1.5.0 - February 4, 2005
  * Added new filter parameter 'fltr' that is an array and
    can apply multiple effects in sequence. Current filters
    that can be called are:
    - 'gam' (Gamma Correction) [ex: &fltr[]=gam|<value>]
      where <value> can be a number >0 to 10+ (default 1.0)
    - 'ds' (DeSaturate) [ex: &fltr[]=ds|<value>]
      where <value> is a number between zero (no change)
      and 100 (complete desaturation -- grayscale), or it
      can be a negative number for saturation boost.
      (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)
    - 'clr' (Colorize) [ex: &fltr[]=clr|<value>|<color>]
      where <value> is a number between 0 and 100 for the
      amount of colorization, and <color> is the hex color
      to colorize to.  (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)
    - 'neg' (Negative) [ex: &fltr[]=neg]
      inverts the color
    - 'th' (ThresHold) [ex: &fltr[]=th|<val>] (range 0-255)
      every grayscale pixel brighter than <val> is set to
      white, every darker pixel is set to black
      (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)
    - 'usm' (UnSharpMask) [ex: &fltr[]=usm|<a>|<r>|<t>]
      where <a> is the amount (default = 80), <r> is the

      where <x> is the horizontal corner radius,
      <y> is the vertical corner radius
  * Split out filter functions into phpthumb.filters.php
  * 'usa','usr','ust' parameters have been removed and
    replaced with the 'fltr' call (see above)

  * Added 'ttf_directory' configuration parameter for
    TrueType watermarks  (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)
  * Added "Last-Modified" header to cache portion of

    cause an error image to be displayed if the cache
    directory isn't configured, unless explicitly disabled
  * Added 'nooffsitelink_enabled' configuration which
    prevents linking to thumbnails on your server from
    another domain. Defaults to watermaking linked images

    cached the same as the local cached version)
  * Added setSourceImageResource() to allow use of an
    existing GD image resource for thumbnailing
    (thanks dan�gonmad*co*uk)

    was used directly  (thanks olgradin�checkfree*com)
  * Bugfix: phpThumb.demo.showpic.php was broken by popup
    blockers for images larger than the screen.
    (thanks mail�mmjaeger*com)

v1.4.11 - October 11, 2004
  * Changed sx/sy/sw/sh parameters to allow decimal values
    (>0 but <1) to represent percent of source image
    (thanks mordor�default*co*yu)
  * Added config_error_silent_die_on_error for no-output
    die on fatal errors (thanks johannes�formformat*se)
  * Added auto-detection of probable 'document_root' if
    that key is not available in $_SERVER
  * Bugfix: Check `which convert` failing with error
    message (thanks chad�chadshome*com)
  * Bugfix: Image cropping to invalid areas outside source
    image caused text output (thanks mordor�default*co*yu)

v1.4.10 - August 22, 2004
  * Bugfix: cached files not written in most cases
    (thanks kizer�courtkizer*com, snuff�inbox*ru)
  * Bugfix: ApacheLookupURIarray() crashes in CGI mode
    (thanks hanskrentel�yahoo*de)
  * Bugfix: phpthumb_bmpfile2gd() was broken
    (thanks i�mindlace*net)

v1.4.9 - August 9, 2004
  * Bugfix: changed destination filename in RenderToFile()
    (thanks alextk�walla*com)
  * Bugfix: problems with HTTP image source when called as
    an object (thanks alextk�walla*com)

v1.4.8 - August 4, 2004
  * $this->error has changed to $this->errors and is now
    an array of strings (instead of a single string)
  * A lot more error conditions (invalid cache directory,
    etc) are now reported in $this->errors
    (thanks aidan*slingsby�lineone*net)
  * Removed all define(CONSTANT) in the phpThumb()
    constructor - you can now access:
    - PHPTHUMB_VERSION   == $this->phpthumb_version;
    - PHPTHUMB_OSSLASH   == $this->osslash;
    - PHPTHUMB_ISWINDOWS == $this->iswindows;
  * Bugfix: Error message from apache_lookup_uri() failing
    under Apache2 now reported cleanly
    (thanks derbaff�yahoo*com)
  * Bugfix: missing phpthumb_functions:: class name for
    ImageTypeToMIMEtype() call in ExtractEXIFgetImageSize()
    (thanks aidan*slingsby�lineone*net)
  * Bugfix: ImageTypeToMIMEtype() was broken for PHP older
    than v4.3.0  (thanks georg*schreiber�batch-pc*es)
  * Bugfix: RenderToFile() now returns false if it fails
    (thanks phpthumb�sendthemtomir*com)
  * Bugfix: Corrupt JPEG/PNG/GIF files that failed
    ImageCreateFrom*() were not being passed to ImageMagick
    for fallback, nor passed through unmodified if IM was
    unavailable or failed  (thanks r*chong�mogenic*net)
  * Bugfix: Improved backtick safe-mode limit detection
    (thanks 1�adamcarrington*com)
  * Bugfix: EXIF thumbnails were being used as source when
    they should not be  (thanks aidan*slingsby�lineone*net)
  * Bugfix: Cached files were not being created or used
    properly  (thanks aidan*slingsby�lineone*net)
  * Bugfix: max_source_pixels not set correct on some PHP
    versions  (thanks derbaff�yahoo*com)
  * Bugfix: 'down' parameter ignored for unprocessed and
    cached files  (thanks aidan*slingsby�lineone*net)

v1.4.7 - July 27, 2004
  * Included a modified version of "module.graphic.bmp.php"
    from getID3() [http://getid3.sourceforge.net] as
    "phpthumb.bmp.php" for BMP reading support without
    ImageMagick. It works, but it's *very* slow, especially
    for large images (as in 640x480 or larger).
  * Added check to prevent error messages when shell_exec
    is disabled (thanks webmaster�neester*com)

v1.4.6 - July 22, 2004
  * Added new section to phpthumb.config.php where you can
    easily specify defaults for any parameter you can set
    in the URL. Normally URL parameters override these
    default values, unless you set
    $PHPTHUMB_DEFAULTS_GETSTRINGOVERRIDE to false
  * Renamed phpthumb.config.php to phpThumb.config.php
    since it's part of phpThumb.php, not part of
    phpthumb.class.php (change of case only, will not
    affect Windows servers, but will affect *nix)
  * Changed cached filename of rawImageData-source images
    from urlencode('') to md5(rawImageData). This should
    make caching thumbnails from non-file sources more
    reliable.
  * Added ImageMagick debugging information
  * Removed unneccesary default values from cached
    filenames. This may invalidate some previously cached
    files. phpthumb.demo.cacheconvert.php has been updated
    to handle v1.4.1-1.4.5 => v1.4.6+ cache filenames.
  * Bugfix: Cached filename did not have file-modified
    datestamp when used as implmented in phpThumb.php
  * Bugfix: RenderToFile() now accepts relative filenames
    (thanks aidan*slingsby�lineone*net)
  * Bugfix: AllowOutputEnlargment setting was ignored when
    falling back to ImageMagick
  * Bugfix: IgnoreAspectRatio setting was ignored when
    falling back to ImageMagick
  * Bugfix: config_temp_directory was ignored in gd_info()
    in PHP < v4.3.0 when phpinfo() returns no GD
    information (due to safe mode restrictions)
    (thanks mimyrtek�myrtek*com)

v1.4.5 - June 28, 2004
  * Added new parameter 'down' where you can specify a
    filename and OutputThumbnail() will cause the file
    to be downloaded rather than displayed in the browser.
    Demo images on silisoftware.com/scripts/phpThumb/demo/
    can all be downloaded to show off this feature.
    (thanks stuartscrump�yahoo*co*uk)
  * Added ability to remove old files from cache directory
    based on last-access time and/or number of cached files
    and/or total size of cached files
    (thanks jrmhaig�yahoo*co*uk)
  * Added public CleanUpCacheDirectory() for cache cleaning
    (see above) if you need to call it manually
  * Included new file phpThumb.demo.cacheconvert.php to
    convert old-style cache names to the current (and
    hopefully last!) standard naming convention.
    (thanks joshg�twcny*rr*com)
  * Added configuration value 'document_root' for rare case
    when $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] return incorrect value
    (thanks joshg�twcny*rr*com)
  * Now tries to create thumbnail with ImageMagick if
    ImageCreateFromJPEG etc fails, before falling back to
    outputting unmodified source data.
  * Bugfix: HTTP image sources were broken
    (thanks fritz*weisshart�t-online*de)
  * Bugfix: ImageMagick callout wasn't being used if EXIF
    thumbnail was available
    (thanks joshg�twcny*rr*com)
  * Bugfix: HTTP src with space in filename was broken
    (thanks dr�rhodes360*com)
  * Bugfix: version_compare_replacement() was broken for
    PHP v4.1.0+

v1.4.4 - June 8, 2004
  * Bugfix: network-share (Windows) source filenames were
    not possible. Now works, but you must use the network
    name and not a mapped drive name, for example:
    \\othercomputer\file.jpg - good
    \\192.168.2.1\file.jpg - good
    z:\file.jpg - won't work
    This is a PHP limitation (see www.php.net/file-exists)
    Note: you may want to use "/" slashes instead of "\" if
    you have magic_quotes_gpc enabled to avoid stripslashes
    problems.
    (thanks dr�rhodes360*com)
  * Bugfix: missing "phpthumb_functions::" in
    ImageCreateFromStringReplacement()
    (thanks zapletal�softwaremedia*cz)

v1.4.3 - May 25, 2004
  * Added new configuration variable 'config_temp_directory'
    to allow you to specify a writable directory name for
    temp files if you do not have access to the system temp
    directory on your server (Safe Mode restrictions etc)
    (thanks nick�regenmag*com)
  * Added new configuration variable
    'config_error_die_on_error' which can be set to false if
    you want to retrieve the error message without having it
    dumped as an image - the error message is now available
    in $phpThumb->error
  * Images are passed through directly with no processing
    and no caching if no parameters are passed to alter the
    image (resize, crop, sharpening, etc)
    (thanks nchmura�users*sourceforge*net)
  * Added new configuration variable 'config_disable_debug'
    which disabled phpThumbDebug from working if you have
    security concerns about the displayed information
  * Bugfix: Added detection at the top of phpThumb.php for
    no-GD errors to avoid parse errors later in the code
    (thanks nick�regenmag*com)
  * Bugfix: RoundedImageCorners() had some off-by-1 errors
    (thanks ola*thunberg�home*se)

v1.4.2 - May 10, 2004
  * Added IE-compatability mode for transparent corners
    (set 'bct=256')
  * Bugfix: version_compare_replacement() was broken in PHP
    older than 4.1.0
    (thanks nick�regenmag*com)

v1.4.1.1 - May 9, 2004
 * Bugfix: Removed ImageTrueColorToPalette hack.
   See http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=28341
 * Bugfix: 'maxb' option for PNG/GIF output incorrect
   bit depth under some circumstances

v1.4.1 - May 9, 2004
 * Added 'maxb' (MAXimum Bytes) option to auto-set the
   output image quality (JPEG) or bit depth (PNG/GIF) so
   that the output thumbnail is less than 'maxb' bytes
   (thanks e_belle�hotmail*com)
 * Added 'bgt' parameter to make rounded corners from
   'brx'/'bry' option transparent when used with PNG
   output. Note: PHP/GD appears buggy at this time, so this
   option must force output to 256-color mode for this
   to work. The feature will be updated when a non-broken
   version of PHP/GD is released.
   (thanks javier�ircorion*net)
 * Bugfix: Caching was broken
   (thanks mike�gdaymate*nl, jurewicz�go3*pl)

v1.4.0 - April 30, 2004
 * Rewritten as a PHP class. Split into several files:
   - phpthumb.class.php        = most processing code
   - phpthumb.functions.php    = support functions
   - phpthumb.readme.txt       = usage instructions
   - phpthumb.changelog.txt    = this file
   - phpthumb.config.php       = configuration file
   - phpthumb.gif.php          = Non-GD GIF reading support
   - phpthumb.unsharp.php      = Unsharp Masking support
   - phpThumb.php              = demo script that works
       exactly as previous versions; this is a drop-in
       replacement for existing phpThumb() installations
   - phpThumb.demo.showpic.php = demo script that auto-
       resizes a popup window to the size of the image
       shown. Useful if you want popup images but do not
       know the large image size beforehand
 * Added optional call-out to ImageMagick (if avaible) if
   source image is larger than PHP memory restrictions
   allow. ImageMagick installation should be auto-detected
   under *nix, but you should configure 'imagemagick_path'
   for use under Windows.
 * 'max_source_pixels' is now auto-calculated from PHP
   configuration settings. Due to various server-level
   restrictions that may override PHP settings this
   calculated value may not always be correct, and you may
   have to specify the value manually.
 * Added rounded-corner border option. You must specify
   both 'brx' (horizontal radius) and 'bry' (vertical
   radius) as well as 'bw' (border width). If 'bw' is
   greater than zero, the image will be shrunk to fit
   inside the border with a margin of background color.
   If 'bw' is zero, the corners of the image will be
   cut off and filled with background color.
   (thanks javier�ircorion*net)
 * Minor speed improvement for unsharp masking

v1.3.7 - March 28, 2004
 * Bugfix: GD version detection was broken on PHP <4.3.0
   on servers where phpinfo() was disabled
   (thanks javier�ircorion*net)
 * Bugfix: Non-GD GIF support was broken on restricted
   PHP configurations
   (thanks javier�ircorion*net)
 * Bugfix: phpThumb.gif.php output error messages if PHP
   was running in Safe Mode
 * Added 'iar' parameter (Ignore Aspect Ratio) to allow
   non-proportional resizing (stretch image to fit).
   You must specify 'h' and 'w' to use this option.
   (thanks javier�ircorion*net)

v1.3.6 - March 14, 2004
  * Bugfix: was broken when register_globals turned on
    (thanks joshg�twcny*rr*com)
  * Bugfix: Images with transparent backgrounds now have
    the background color filled with the color specified
    by the 'bg' parameter
  * Bugfix: ImageCreateFromString() is broken in the
    non-bundled GD. Added workaround, but please use
    the bundled version of GD if possible
    (thanks dn�xbe*ch)
  * Bugfix: EXIF thumbnail caching was broken
  * Bugfix: EXIF thumbnail handling was broken for PHP
    v4.2.x
    (thanks smithk1�shaw*ca)
  * Bugfix: Image borders with GD2 were misaligned
  * Bugfix: virtual paths/filenames like /~user/foo.jpg
    should now work properly, if PHP is installed as an
    Apache module (see www.php.net/apache-lookup-uri)
  * Bugfix: contents of any non-image file could be
    displayed (including PHP & HTML files)
    (thanks arsyan�arsyan*com)
  * Added rotation parameters 'ra' and 'ar'
    (thanks dr�rhodes360*com)
  * Added $CONFIG['output_allow_enlarging'], defaulted
    to false, to prevent smaller-than-max-size images
    from being enlarged beyond their original size. If
    you want to be able to enlarge images, set this to
    false. Can be overridden with the 'aoe' parameter
    (thanks dn�xbe*ch)
  * Changed all configuration variables to be under one
    array named $CONFIG
  * Moved color and font options for ErrorImage() to
    $CONFIG variables
  * Changed cached filename structure (again) to a more
    flexible format that can handle future expansion
    (old cached files are invalid and will be recreated)
  * Added more debugging code to phpThumbDebug

v1.3.5 - February 29, 2004
  * Added capability to use EXIF thumbnail that may be
    embedded in source image (often is in digital camera
    JPEGs) and source image dimensions are larger than
    $config_max_source_pixels. This will overcome the
    limitation where PHP runs out of memory processing
    large images (usually >1600x1200). EXIF thumbnail
    extraction requires PHP v4.2.0 or higher and EXIF
    support compiled into PHP (or php_exif extension)
  * Eliminated intermediate read-file-to-memory stage if
    image is created from local file. Should allow
    larger images to be processed without running out of
    memory.
  * Added optional 'goto' parameter to be used with the
    'file' parameter, where 'goto' is a URL that is
    redirected to after image is rendered to file
    (thanks wimble�webdonors*com)
  * Added optional 'xto' parameter that will bypass all
    processing and just return the embedded EXIF
    thumbnail, if available.
  * Added error-handling if ImageTypes() is unavailable

v1.3.4 - February 15, 2004
  * Custom error image option (&err=img.jpg) which can
    also be set as $config_error_message_image_default
    (thanks carl�4thstar*net)
  * &f=text will now output plain-text error messages
  * ErrorImage() now used for anti-hotlink messages (if
    $config_nohotlink_erase_image is true)

v1.3.3 - February 5, 2004
  * Bugfix: Added stripslashes() to filenames if
    magic_quotes_gpc is enabled
    (thanks arsyan�arsyan*com)
  * Output can now be rendered to a file only (not to
    browser) specified by the 'file' parameter
    (thanks arsyan�arsyan*com)
  * JPEG quality now has a maximum of 95%, as specified
    in the GD documentation

v1.3.2.1 - February 3, 2004
  * Bugfix: gd_version() was broken for GD v2.0+
  * Bugfix: removed debugging code

v1.3.2 - February 3, 2004
  * Bugfix: when borders are enabled, portait images
    with no width constraint, or landscape images with
    no height constraint were smaller than neccesary by
    double the border width
    (thanks jjj�xs4all*nl)
  * Added unsharp mask option thanks to Torstein H�nsi:
    http://www.vikjavev.com/hovudsida/umtestside.php
    Note: requires GD v2.x to function
    (thanks jjj�xs4all*nl)
  * Updated cache filenames to reflect new parameters,
    this means old cached files will need to be deleted
    (or not, they just will never get called again) and
    new cached versions will be created.
  * Added caching to gd_info() calls for minor speedup

v1.3.1 - February 2, 2004
  * Added optional border (width and color configurable)
    (thanks arsyan�arsyan*com)
  * Added option to create fixed-dimension thumbnails
    regardless of source aspect ration. Set the 'bw'
    (BorderWidth) parameter (even to 0) and this will be
    enabled. Outside the actual image will be filled
    with 'bg' color (default FFFFFF)
    (thanks arsyan�arsyan*com)

v1.3.0 - January 27, 2004
  * Added watermarking option to overlay thumbnails with
    a semi-transparent watermark image (copied from a
    seperate source watermark image)
    (thanks arsyan�arsyan*com)
  * Added option for absolute filenames (on both Windows
    and *nix) outside the DOCUMENT_ROOT directory
  * Added debug output dump for diagnosing problems)

v1.2.8 - January 19, 2004
  * added ability to specify relative pathnames as well
    as absolute pathnames (pathname is relative to the
    location of phpThumb.php if the passed source does
    not begin with "/"

v1.2.7 - January 7, 2004
  * Added patch to allow use of PHP older than 4.1.0
    (or GD without PNG support) for non-GD GIF support
    (thanks hostwebserver�hotmail*com)

v1.2.6 - January 4, 2004
  * Added patch to allow use of PHP older than 4.1.0
    (without the superglobals arrays)

v1.2.5 - December 26, 2003
  * Added configuration options for default output image
    format and max width/height

v1.2.4 - December 20, 2003
  * Bugfix: temp directory for non-native GD support not
    always returning valid directory
  * Caching feature reintroduced (see configuration)

v1.2.3 - December 19, 2003
  * Added anti-hotlink code so the thumbnail script on
    one domain cannot be used by another domain. The
    list of allowed domains defaults to the current
    domain but is configurable below as
    $config_nohotlink_valid_domains. The message, text
    size, colors and whether to blank the image or not
    are also configurable
  * Bugfix: URL image sources were not able to use the
    non-GD GIF-reading functions

v1.2.2 - December 17, 2003
  * Added option to use http:// URL as image source

v1.2.1 - December 11, 2003
  * Added option to get source data from a database
    rather than a physical file
  * Bugfix: resize not proportional when wide image
    limited more by max height than max width
    Thanks mathias_strasser�gmx*net
  * Removed caching code

v1.2.0 - December 10, 2003
  * Added GIF support for versions of GD that do not
    have built-in GIF support (v1.6.x) via the "GIF
    Util" class by Fabien Ezber (www.yamasoft.com)
    GD's built-in GIF-reading functions are faster, and
    are present in PHP v4.3.0 or newer, but all versions
    of GD can display resized GIF thumbnails now.

v1.1.2 - October 26, 2003
  * check for source image existance to prevent text
    error messages
  * if GD not available, a GIF saying "no GD" is shown
    instead of showing the original image
  * Cache feature introduced

v1.1.1 - September 28, 2003
  * better resize code by sfisher10�cox*net

v1.1.0 - September 1, 2003
  * initial public release
  * thumbnails can now be larger than source image
  * graphical error messages

v1.0.0 - January 7, 2002
  * initial private release
